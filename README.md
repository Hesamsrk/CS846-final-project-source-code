## Acknowledgement 
The IITP_VDLand dataset used in this research was retrieved from the paper: [IITP-VDLand: A Comprehensive Dataset on Decentraland Parcels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07533). We extend our gratitude to the authors for providing access to this dataset, which significantly contributed to the advancement of our study on virtual land analysis.

As the dataset has not been formally and publicly released, it is not included in this repository. For access to the dataset, please contact [Hesam Sarkhosh](mailto:hsarkhos@uwaterloo.ca) or the IITP_VDLand contributors.

I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to Jun Lim ([jun.lim@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:jun.lim@uwaterloo.ca)) and Ayinde Yakubu ([ayakubu@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:ayakubu@uwaterloo.ca)) for their valuable contributions to certain aspects of the data analysis, conducted as part of an informal collaborative research initiative.
